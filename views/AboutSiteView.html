<h4>
    I designed and built this interactive resume using the following libraries:
</h4>
    <ul id="languages">
        <li>AngularJS</li>
        <li>Angular UI-Bootstrap</li>
        <li>Angular UI-Router</li>
    </ul>
<h4> And of course, the following programming languages:
</h4>
    <ul id="languages">
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
    </ul>

        I had some guidance from peers, and the occasional assistance from the Stack Overflow Community!
